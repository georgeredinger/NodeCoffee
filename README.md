Monitor the office coffee pot with nodejs 
===

Todo:
=

# configure udev permissions on mouse input devices (/dev/input/event?) so node process has read permissions
# Detect mouse(s) and associate with sensors, possibly with a config file
# Serve the pots status via a http server
# Tweet coffee done
# Control X10 devices to indicate coffee done and age
# detect pot brew, heating and off states
